### These are some important concepts in stats to be solved
### Explanation is provided to have a glance, Examples here are the questions to be solved
#### You have mastered the basics—now you are ready to take it up a notch.

## 1. Joint Probability refers to the probability of occurrence involving two or more events

Let A and B be the two events in a sample space. Then the joint probability if the two events denoted by P(A $\cap$ B), is 
given by 
$P(A \cap B) = \frac{Number \quad of \quad observations \quad in \quad A \cap B } {Total \quad Number \quad of \quad observations}$ 

### Example:
At a popular company service center, a total of 100 complaints were received. 80 customers complained about late delivery of 
the items and 60 complained about poor product quality.

a) Calculate the probability that a customer complaint will be about both product quality and late delivery.

b) What is the probability that a complaint will be only about late delivery?

### Solution:
    
a) Calculate the probability that a customer complaint will be about both product quality and late delivery

Let

L = Late delivery

Q = Poor quality

n(L) = Number of cases in favour of L = 80

n(Q) = Number of cases in favour of Q = 60

N = Total Number of complaints = 100 

L intersection Q = 40

Probability that a customer complaint will be about both product quality and late delivery = $P(L \cap Q)$

$P(L \cap Q) =  \frac{n(L \cap Q)} {Total \quad Number \quad of \quad observations}$ 

FE4 = 40
TE  = 100
PE4 = round(FE4 / TE,4) 
print('a.Probability that a customer complaint will\n\
       be about both product quality and late delivery. is %1.4f' % PE4)

b. What is the probability that a complaint will be only about late delivery

# FE5 is the complaints about poor quality
FE5 = 60
TE  = 100
PE5 = round(FE5 / TE,4) 
PE6 = 1 - PE5
# So,1 - PE5 is the Probability that a customer complaint will be about
#        both product quality and late delivery 
print('b.probability that a complaint will be \n\
         only about late delivery. is %1.4f' % PE6)

## 2. Conditional Probability refers to the probability of event A, given information about the occurrence of another event B

Probability of A given B is written as P(A | B).

$P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A \quad and \quad B)}{P(B)}$

where P(A and B) = Joint probability of A and B
*     P(A)       = Marginal probability of A
*     P(B)       = Marginal probability of B

### Example:
The following table describes loan default status at a bank and their marital status. 

| Marital Status | Loan Defaulted | Loan No Default | Marginal Total |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| Single | 42 | 258 | 300 |
| Married | 60 | 590 | 650 |
| Divorced | 13 | 37 | 50 |
| Marginal Total | 115 | 885 | 1000 |


Based on the above table, calculate the probability of default given divorced.

### Solution:

# P1 = P(Default and Divorced)
P1   = 13 / 1000
# P2 = P(Divorced)
P2   = 50 / 1000
#P3  = P(Default | Divorced) = P(Default and Divorced) / P(Divorced)
P3   = P1 / P2
print('P(Default | Divorced)  is %1.4f' % P3)    

## 3. Binomial distribution

It is widely used probability distribution of a discrete random variable. 

Plays major role in quality control and quality assurance function. 

$P(X = x\mid n,\pi)$ = $\frac{n!}{x!(n - x)!}\pi^x (1 - \pi)^{n-x} $
* where P(X = x) is the probability of getting x successes in n trials
and $\pi$ is the probability of an event of interest

### Some important functions in Python for Binomial distribution:

#### 1) Probability mass function

##### scipy.stats.binom.pmf gives the probability mass function for the binomial distribution

binomial = scipy.stats.binom.pmf (k,n,p), 
* where k is an array and takes values in {0, 1,..., n}
* n and p are shape parameters for the binomial distribution

The output, binomial, gives probability of binomial distribution function in terms of array.

#### 2) Cumulative Density function

cumbinomial = scipy.stats.binom.cdf(k,n,p) gives cumulative binomial distribution.

The output, cumbinomial, gives cumulative probability of binomial distribution function in terms of array.

####  3)  Plot the binomial Density function

The function, matplotlib.pyplot.plot(k, binomial, ‘o-’) gives us plot of the binomial distribution function.

### Example
The percentage of orders filled correctly at Wendy's was approximately 86.8%. Suppose that you go to drive-through window at 
Wendy's and place an order. Two friends of yours independently place orders at the drive-through window at the same Wendy's.

What are the probabilities that 
* a) all three 
* b) none of the three
* c) atleast two of the three orders will be filled correctly?
* d) what is the mean and standard deviation of the orders filled correctly?

### Solution

import numpy as np
p   =  0.868 # percentage of orders filled correctly at Wendy's was approximately 86.8%
n   =  3
k   =  np.arange(0,4)

from scipy import stats
binomial = stats.binom.pmf(k,n,p)

print(binomial)

print('a) all the three orders are filled correctly? is %1.4f' %binomial[3])

print('b) none of the three orders are filled correctly? is %1.4f' %binomial[0])

To answer this question c) atleast two of the three orders are filled correctly, we need to find out 1 - Probability of upto 1 
failure

cumbinomial = stats.binom.cdf(k,n,p)

print(cumbinomial)

P = 1 - cumbinomial[1]
print('c) atleast two of the three orders are filled correctly? is %1.4f' % P)

# d) what is the mean and standard deviation of the orders filled correctly?
p    = 0.868
n    = 3
mean = n* p # = 3 * 0.868
sd   = np.sqrt(n * p * (1 - p))
print('mean and standard deviation of the orders filled correctly are %1.4f and  %1.4f respectively' % (mean, sd))

### Plot  the binomial distribution function

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(k,binomial, 'o-')
plt.title('Binomial')
plt.xlabel('Number of Orders filled correctly')
plt.ylabel('Prob of Orders filled correctly')
plt.show()

## 4. Poisson Distribution

* This discrete distribution which also plays a major role in quality control. 
* The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution for the counts of events that occur randomly in a given 
interval of time or space. In such areas of opportunity, there can be more than one occurrence. In such situations, Poisson 
distribution can be used to compute probabilities.
* Examples include number of defects per item, number of defects per transformer produced. 
* Notes: Poisson Distribution helps to predict the arrival rate in a waiting line situation where a queue is formed and people 
wait to be served and the service rate is generally higher than the arrival rate.

### Properties:
* Mean                     μ  = λ
* Standard deviation       σ  = √ μ
* The Poisson distribution is the limit of binomial distribution as n approaches ∞and p approaches 0


P(X = x) = $\frac{e^\lambda \lambda^x}{x!} $
where 
* P(x)              = Probability of x successes given an idea of  $\lambda$
* $\lambda$ = Average number of successes
* e                   = 2.71828 (based on natural logarithm)
* x                    = successes per unit which can take values 0,1,2,3,... $\infty$

### Applications

1. Car Accidents
2. Number of deaths by horse kicking in Prussian Army (first application)
3. Birth defects and genetic mutation

### Note

* If there is a fixed number of observations, n, each of which is classified as an event of interest or not an event of interest, use the binomial distribution.
* If there is an area of opportunity, use the Poisson distribution.


### Example
The number of work-related injuries per month in a manufacturing plant is known to follow a Poisson distribution, with a mean  
of 2.5 work-related injuries a month. What is the probability that in a given month, 

a) No work related injuries occur? 

b) At least one work-related injury occurs?

### Solution

Here, 
$\lambda$ = 2.5 injuries

rate =  2.5 # which is the mean
n    =  np.arange(0,20)
poisson = stats.poisson.pmf(n,rate)

poisson

print(' a) Probability that No work related injuries occur is %1.4f' % poisson[0])

To calculate the probability that at least one work-related injury occurs, we need to subtract probability of no work related 
injury from 1.

# P = probability that at least one work-related injury occurs
P   = 1 - poisson[0]
print(' b) Probability that that at least one work-related injury occurs is %1.4f' % P)

Plot the Poisson distribution function

plt.plot(n,poisson, 'o-')
plt.title('Poisson')
plt.xlabel('Number of Work related injuries')
plt.ylabel('Prob of Work related injuries')
plt.show()

## 5. Normal Distribution

* One of the most popular continuous distribution in Analytics field.
* Normal distribution is observed across many naturally occurring measures such as birth weight, height and intelligence etc

#### Probability Density Function

f(x) = $\frac {1}{\sigma\sqrt(2 \pi)} e^\frac {-(x-\mu^2)}{2\sigma^2}$

Where

* f(x) is used to represent a probability density function
* x is any value of the continuous variable, where -∞ < x < ∞
* e denotes the mathematical constant approximated by 2.71828
* Π is a mathematical constant approximated by 3.14159
* μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution

For a continuous function, the probability density function is the probability that the value has the value x. 
Since for continuous distributions the probability at a single point is zero, this is expressed in terms of an integral of its probability density function
P(X<= x) = F(x) = 
$\int_{-\infty}^xf(t)dt$


Its pdf is given by

fZ(z) = $\frac{1}{ √2Π} {exp \frac {-z2} {2}}$

for all z $\in R$

The (1 / √2Π ) is there to make sure that the area under the PDF is 1.

* For a normal distribution, mu is the location parameter, which locates (centre) the distribution on the horizontal axis.
* Sigma is the scale parameter, which defines the spread of the normal distribution.
* Normal distribution has no shape parameter since all the normal distribution curves have bell shape and are symmetrical.

### Properties
1. Theoretical normal density functions are defined between -∞ and ∞
2. There are two parameters, location (μ which is the mean) and scale (σ which is standard deviation).
3. It has a symmetrical (bell shape) around the mean. mean = median = mode
4. Areas between specific values are measured in terms of μ and σ
5. Any linear transformation if a normal random variable is also normal random variable.
6. If X1 is an independent normal random variable with mean μ1 and variance $\sigma1^2$ and 
      X2 is another independent normal random variable with mean μ2 and$\sigma2^2$, 
then X1 + X2 is also a normal distribution with mean μ1 + μ2 and variance $\sigma1^2$ + $\sigma2^2$ 

| Value of the random variable | Area under the normal distribution (CDF) |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------|
| $\mu - \sigma \leq x \leq \mu + \sigma$ | 0.6828 |
| $\mu - 2\sigma \leq x \leq \mu + 2\sigma$ | 0.9545 |
| $\mu - 3\sigma \leq x \leq \mu + 3\sigma$ | 0.9974 |

### Example:

The mean salaries of Data Scientists working in Chennai, India is calculated to be 7,00,000 INR with a standard deviation of 90,000 INR. The random variable salary of Data Scientists follows a normal distribution.

* a) What is the probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary more than 10,00,000 INR?
* b) What is the probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary between 6,00,000 & 9,00,000 INR?
* c) What is the probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary less than 4,00,000 INR?

### Solution

# a) What is the probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary more than 10,00,000 INR?
mu    =  700000
sigma =  90000
z=(1000000-mu) / sigma 

P = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(z)
print(' a) Probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary more than 10,00,000 is %1.4f' % P)

# b) What is the probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary between 6,00,000 & 9,00,000 INR?
z1= (600000-mu) / sigma
z2= (900000-mu) / sigma

P = stats.norm.cdf(z2) - stats.norm.cdf(z1)
print(' b) probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary between 6,00,000 & 9,00,000 INR is %1.4f' % P)

# c) What is the probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary less than 4,00,000 INR?
z = (400000-mu) / sigma 

P = stats.norm.cdf(z)
print(' c) Probability that a Data Scientist in Chennai has a salary less than 4,00,000 INR is %1.4f' % P)

## 6.Central Limit Theorem

* Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most important theorems in Statistics due to its applications in testing of 
hypothesis.

* CLT states that for a large sample drawn from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the sampling 
distribution of mean, follows an approximate normal distribution with mean, μ and standard error σ / √(n) irrespective of the 
distribution of the population for large sample size.

* Let S1, S2, ..., Sk be samples of size n, drawn from an independent and identically distributed population with mean, μ and 
standard deviation, σ. 

* Let be $\overline{X_1}$, $\overline{X_2}$, ..., $\overline{X_k}$,  the sample means of the samples (S1, S2, ..., Sk ). 

* According to CLT, the distribution of $\overline{X_1}$, $\overline{X_2}$, ..., $\overline{X_k}$, follows a normal 
distribution with mean, μ and standard deviation, σ / √(n) for large value of n. 

* As a general rule, statisticians have found that for many population distribution, when the sample size is at least 30, the 
sampling distribution of the mean is approximately **normal.**

### Implications of CLT
* 1) X - μ / (σ / √(n) ~ N(0,1)
* 2) If Sn = X1 + X2 + ... + Xn, then E(Sn) = nμ and Standard Error is σ √(n)
* The random variable (Sn - nμ ) / (σ √(n))  is a standard normal variate

### Example
A hospital is interested in estimating the average time it takes to discharge a patient after the doctor signs the discharge 
summary sheet. 

Calculate the required sample size at a confidence level of 95%. Assume that the population standard deviation is 25 minutes. The Hospital wants the estimate of the mean to be within +/- 5 mins

### Solution

From the CLT (Central Limit theorem), we know that the sampling distribution of the mean follows a normal distribution with 
mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.  

**Standard Normal Variate Z = $\frac{\overline{X},- \mu} {\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$**

So, $\sqrt{n} = {\frac{Z \quad \times \quad \sigma} {\overline{X} - \mu}}$

* Let  Diff = $\overline{X}- \mu$ 
* Diff = 5 minutes
* $\sigma = 25 $
* $\alpha = 0.05$

# Let n be the sample size

import  scipy.stats as stats
import  numpy       as np

Z     = round(stats.norm.isf(q = 0.025),2) # We need to calculate the value of Z at (alpha/2) when alpha = 0.05
sigma = 25
D     = 5

print(np.abs(Z))

n = round(((np.abs(Z) * sigma ) / D)**2,0)

print('The required sample size at a confidence level of %d%s is %d' % (95,'%',n))

## 7.Setting up Hypothesis

### Type I Error, Type II error and power of the hypothesis test

### Type I error

* It is the conditional probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true, is called **Type I error or False positive.
**
* $\alpha$, the level of significance is the value of Type I error.
* P(Reject null hypothesis | $H_0$ is true) = $\alpha$

### Type II error

* It is the conditional probability of retaining a null hypothesis when it is true, is called **Type II error or False Negative.
**
* $\beta$, is the value of Type II error.
* P(Retain null hypothesis | $H_0$ is false) = $\beta$

### Power of the test

* (1 - $\beta$) is known as the **power of the test**.
* It is P(Reject null hypothesis | $H_0$ is false) = 1- $\beta$

## Steps involved in solving the hypothesis testing

### 1 Define null and alternative hypothesis

* ### Null hypothesis means no relationship or status quo
* ### Alternative hypothesis is what the researcher wants to prove

### 2: Decide the significance level

Choose the $\alpha$, the level of significance according to the relative importance of the risks of committing Type I and Type II errors in the problem. 

### 3:  Identify the test statistic

### 4: Calculate the critical value

We know the $\alpha$ is 0.05. So, the critical values of the $Z_STAT$ test statistic are -1.96 and 1.96.

### 5 Decide to reject or accept null hypothesis

### Example 

A beverages company produces mineral water and available in 250 ml, 500 ml, 1 litre and 2 litre bottles, 5 litre, 15 litre and 
20 litre jars.
Let us consider 2 litre bottles. Company specification require a mean volume of 2 litre per bottle.
You must adjust the water filling process when the mean volume in the population of bottles differs from 2 litres. Adjusting 
the process requires shutting down the water filling production line completely, so you do not want to make any adjustments 
without any reason unnecessarily.

Assume a sample of 50 water bottles indicate a sample mean, $\overline{X}$ of 2.001 litres and the population standard 
deviation, $\sigma$ is 15 ml.

#### Hypothesis testing using the critical value approach

## Solution

### Step 1: Define null and alternative hypotheses

In testing whether the mean volume is 2 litres, the null hypothesis states that mean volume, $\mu$ equals 2 litres. The 
alternative hypthesis states that the mean olume, $\mu$ is not equal  to 2 litres.
* $H_0$: $\mu$ = 2
* $H_A$: $\mu$ $\neq$ 2

### Step 2: Decide the significance level

Choose the $\alpha$, the level of significance according to the relative importance of the risks of committing Type I and 
Type II errors in the problem. 

In this example, making a Type I error means that you conclude that the population mean is not 2 litres when it is 2 litres. 
This implies that you will take corrective action on the filling process even though the process is working well (*false alarm*)
.

On the other hand, when the population mean is 1.98 litres and you conclude that the population mean is 2 litres, you commit a 
Type II error. Here, you allow the process to continue without adjustment, even though an adjustment is needed (*missed 
opportunity*).

Here, we select $\alpha$ = 0.05 and n, sample size = 50.

### Step 3:  Identify the test statistic

We know the population standard deviation and the sample is a large sample, n>30. So you use the normal distribution and the
$Z_STAT$ test statistic.

### Step 4: Calculate the critical value

We know the $\alpha$ is 0.05. So, the critical values of the $Z_STAT$ test statistic are -1.96 and 1.96.

print(np.abs(round(stats.norm.isf(q = 0.025),2))) # Here we use alpha by 2  for two-tailed test

* ### Rejection region is $Z_{STAT}$ < -1.96 or $Z_{STAT}$ > 1.96.
* ### Acceptance or non-rejection regions is -1.96 $\leq$ $Z_{STAT}$ $\leq$ 1.96

We collect the sample data, calculate the test statistic. 
In our example, 
* $\overline{X}$ = 2.001
* $\mu$   = 2
* $\sigma$ = 15
* n       = 50
* $Z_{STAT} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu} {\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$ 

XAvg  = 2.001
mu    = 2
sigma = 15
n     = 50
Z = (XAvg - mu)/(sigma/np.sqrt(n))
print('Value of Z is %2.5f' %Z)

In this example, Z = 0.00047 lies in the acceptance region because, 
-1.96 < Z = 0.00047 < 1.96.

So the statistical decision is not to reject the null hypothesis.

### So there is no sufficient evidence  to prove that the mean fill is different from 2 litres.

# 8.One sample and two sample  (test for mean and not for proportion) 

## t test

### Very rarely we know the variance of the population. 

A common strategy to assess hypothesis is to conduct a t test. A t test can tell whether two groups have the same mean. 
A t test can be estimated for:
* 1) One sample t test
* 2) Two sample t test (including paired t test)

We assume that the samples are randomly selected, independent and come from a normally distributed population with unknown but 
equal variances.

### One sample t test

from scipy.stats             import ttest_1samp,ttest_ind, wilcoxon
from statsmodels.stats.power import ttest_power
import matplotlib.pyplot     as     plt

## Two sample test

** Two sample t test (Snedecor and Cochran 1989) is used to determine if two population means are equal.
A common application is to test if a new treatment or approach or process is yielding better results than the current treatment 
or approach or process.**

* 1) Data is *paired* - For example, a group of students are given coaching classes and effect of coaching on the  marks scored 
is determined.
* 2) Data is *not paired* - For example, find out  whether the miles per gallon of  cars of Japanese make is superior to cars 
of Indian make.

## Two sample t test for unpaired data is defined as 
* $H_0$: $\mu1$        = $\mu2$ 
* $H_a$: $\mu1$ $\neq$ = $\mu2$ 

### Test statistic T = $\frac{\overline{X_1} - \overline{X_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{{s_1}^2} {n1}+ \frac{{s_2}^2}{n2}}}$

* where n1 and n2 are the sample sizes and X1 and X2 are the sample means 
* ${S_1}^2$ and ${S_2}^2$ are sample variances

## Example

Compare two unrelated samples. Data was collected on the weight loss of 16 women and 20 men enrolled in a weight reduction 
program.
At $\alpha$ = 0.05, test whether the weight loss of these two samples is different.

### Solution

Weight_loss_Male   = [ 3.69, 4.12, 4.65, 3.19,  4.34, 3.68, 4.12, 4.50, 3.70, 3.09,3.65, 4.73, 3.93, 3.46, 3.28, 4.43, 4.13, 3.62, 3.71, 2.92]
Weight_loss_Female = [2.99, 1.80, 3.79, 4.12, 1.76, 3.50, 3.61, 2.32, 3.67, 4.26, 4.57, 3.01, 3.82, 4.33, 3.40, 3.86]

from    scipy.stats             import  ttest_1samp,ttest_ind, wilcoxon, ttest_ind_from_stats
import  scipy.stats             as      stats  
from    statsmodels.stats.power import  ttest_power
import  matplotlib.pyplot       as      plt

### Step 1: Define null and alternative hypothesis

In testing whether weight reduction of female and male are same,the null hypothesis states that mean weight reduction, $\mu{M}$ equals $\mu{F}$. The alternative hypthesis states that the weight reduction is different for Male and Female, $\mu{M}$ $\neq$ $\mu{F}$

* $H_0$: $\mu{M}$ - $\mu{F}$ =      0
* $H_A$: $\mu{M}$ - $\mu{F}$ $\neq$  0

### Step 2: Decide the significance level

Here we select $\alpha$ = 0.05 and sample size < 30 and population standard deviation is not known.

### Step 3: Identify the test statistic

* We have two samples and we do not know the population standard deviation.
* Sample sizes for both samples are not same.
* The sample is not a large sample, n < 30. So you use the t distribution and the $t_STAT$ test statistic for two sample
unpaired test.

### Step 4: Calculate the p - value and test statistic

** We use the scipy.stats.ttest_ind to calculate the t-test for the means of TWO INDEPENDENT samples of scores given the two 
sample observations. This function returns t statistic and two-tailed p value.**

** This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values. This 
test assumes that the populations have identical variances.**

t_statistic, p_value  =  stats.ttest_ind(Weight_loss_Male,Weight_loss_Female)
print('P Value %1.3f' % p_value)    

### Step 5:  Decide to reject or accept null hypothesis

In this example, p value is 0.076 and it is more than 5% level of significance

So the statistical decision is to accept the null hypothesis at 5% level of significance.

### So there is no sufficient evidence  to reject the null hypothesis that the weight loss of these men and women is same.
